This repository hosts resources related to the CENTRAL study, including atlases, models, and code. It provides, among others, our tissue segmentation model (TUZI; previously referred to as the General Base Model) and TCGA Tumor Maps. We have also deployed an online interactive demo at https://wish.pinglab-nuist.org/wsi-preview/ to explore and experience the CENTRAL tissue segmentation model.
